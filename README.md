# NLP
Welcome everyone to my NLP Project Folder. In this section, I would explore building multiple projects using state of the art models and tackle on various challenges. Stay Tune!! 
Feel free to contact me for any questions or do provide your suggestions to me as I am still new to the field and learning!

## Custom BPE Tokenizer 
Tokenizers are an extremely important part for transformers. It would be important to explore the use of tokenizers; more so, learning how to create on ourselves! 

## Image Captioning Project 
Playing with State of the art models, I attempt to create an Image Captioning model.

## Contextual Hashtag Selection 
With the use of graph theory, I attempt to contextualize groups of hashtags to allow researchers and general users to siphon out useful hashtags for their projects. 

## Winograd Challenge 
The Wino-grad Challenge was a challenge set of predict the selection of nouns in place. The use of transformers have been a really popular method in recent times. For this challenge, I set to create my own fine tune methods to tune a transformer model for this purpose.
