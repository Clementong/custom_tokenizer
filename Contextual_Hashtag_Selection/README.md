# contextual-hashtag-selection
NLP has been a growing field. Much of the recent works with transformers have changed the way we analyse words in context and assign meaning. This work uses some of the state of the art techniques for sentence embeddings, SBERT and  techniques from graph theory to study relationships of Hashtags found in the same context (appearing in the same tweet, hence, sentence than word embeddings).
